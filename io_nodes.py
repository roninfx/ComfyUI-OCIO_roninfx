# ComfyUI-OCIO - Read / Write nodes, modelled on The Foundry Nuke's Read and Write.
# @author Slava Sexton
#
# OCIO Read : load a still / image sequence / video, tell it which colorspace the file is in, and the IMAGE
#             output is already converted to the working colorspace (default sRGB - Display, ComfyUI's space).
#             No separate "convert" toggle: input colorspace -> output colorspace, always. fps comes from the
#             video metadata. Defaults follow the file type (EXR -> ACEScg, JPG/PNG/TIFF -> sRGB - Display).
# OCIO Write: save an IMAGE batch as a still / sequence (EXR / TIFF / PNG) or a video (ProRes / DNxHR / h264 /
#             hevc). from_colorspace (ComfyUI's working space) -> out colorspace (the file's space). The format
#             drives the right colorspace default (EXR -> ACEScg, PNG/TIFF -> sRGB). Folder + name; the
#             sequence numbering is added automatically. A node preview shows the written frame + its
#             colorspace, so a wrong pick (sRGB vs ACEScg) is visible at a glance.
#
# EXR is written directly by cv2 here, NOT by ComfyUI's SaveImage, so ComfyUI's lack of EXR-sequence support
# does not apply. Foundation (confirmed 2026-06-30): cv2 4.13 (EXR/TIFF), tifffile, Pillow, ffmpeg full build
# (prores_ks 4444/HQ, dnxhd, libx264/5). OCIO 2.5.2 ACES studio config for color. EXR needs
# OPENCV_IO_ENABLE_OPENEXR=1 in the server environment (set on launch).

    cannot open DPX at all - so the pack used to fall through to PIL and fail with "UnidentifiedImageError" on
    the single most common plate format in film finishing, while advertising .dpx as supported. imageio does
    read it and hands back UINT8, silently throwing away two of the ten bits, which is worse than failing.

        came back as 00:01:00;02 where the NDF truth is 00:01:00;00: a two-frame conform error, produced from

#
#   The attribute is defined as the luminance, in candelas per square metre, of the RGB value (1,1,1). This node's

#   maps white to white and would keep the number true; a TRANSFER change does not, and this node ships a preset
#   that does exactly that (ACEScct). So an inherited value becomes a confident, checkable, WRONG statement about

#   chromaticities on a converted render, which is what this whole set exists to stop.

#
# Not knowing the true value is a reason not to inherit someone else's, not a reason to pass it on. OCIO's

# ONE predicate for "this must not enter a delivered file", used by EVERY writer in this module (EXR header, MOV /

# 2026-08-12 with the universal sidecar.
#
# WHY IT IS SHARED RATHER THAN PER-FORMAT: two real leaks were measured while extending this, both from the same
# cause - the guard existed on ONE path and the others each grew their own answer or none at all.
#   1. _save_exr_with_meta applied NO guard whatsoever. Reproduced: an EXR left this pack carrying
#      output_folder="D:/secret/project/shots" and ComfyUI's whole `prompt` graph JSON in its header. That is
#      reachable from a normal graph, not a hypothetical - _read_pil_meta returns a ComfyUI PNG's text chunks,
#      which are exactly `prompt` and `workflow`, and OCIO Read -> OCIO Write(EXR) then stamped them into the
#      delivered header. It is the leak this pack refuses in MOV, arriving through the format it writes most.
#   2. The MOV branch's own forbidden test was `kl in _META_FORBIDDEN`, an EXACT membership test against a tuple
#      of SUBSTRINGS. So it matched a key spelled exactly "c2pa" and nothing else: a real "c2pa.manifest" was
#      passed to the container. Measured. It never fired in practice only because OCIOWrite.write() strips those
#      keys earlier via _forbidden_meta_keys - a guard that cannot fire is not a guard.
# Substring matching (and the same normalisation _forbidden_meta_keys uses) is the correct form, because every
# one of these arrives under several spellings depending on who wrote it.

    Neither can do both halves, so the chunks are spliced in afterwards. The pixels are untouched - measured
    bit-identical before and after on a frame with 0 and 65535 pinned in.

    THE POSITION IS THE WHOLE POINT, and it is where the first attempt failed. Chunks written before IEND (i.e.

    png_read_info, before the pixels, and never revisits the end-info. Measured with a control: identical
    chunks before IDAT -> oiiotool lists every key; after IDAT -> oiiotool lists none. OIIO is what Nuke,

# was - one real DNxHR HQ encode per pattern, read back with ffprobe, because MXF has no udta box and what
# survives could not be guessed:
#
#   -f mxf (OP1a)      rc=0, 406 573 bytes for 6 frames at 512x288. Colour tags ALL survive - color_range=tv,
#                      primaries=bt709, trc=bt709, space=bt709 (better than ProRes in a MOV, which loses range).
#                      Timecode survives, in both the format tags and the stream tags. Audio survives as a
#                      second pcm_s24le stream (481 325 bytes with a 0.25 s track).
#   -f mxf_opatom      rc=0, 401 465 bytes, video only. Colour tags and timecode survive identically.
#                      REFUSES a second stream: "there must be exactly one stream for mxf opatom".
#
# Identity tags: of eleven passed as plain -metadata, ONE survives - reel_name, and that one is structural and
# worth relying on. ffmpeg writes it as the Name of the underlying Physical Source Package (local tag 0x4402),
# which is the field Avid means by Tape Name, and its own demuxer documents the field as the reel/tape name.
#
# THE OTHER TEN travel with the `comment_` prefix, and the earlier claim here - that they survive "as ST 377-1
# user comments" - WAS WRONG; corrected 2026-08-12 after checking ffmpeg's source rather than only ffprobe.
# What ffmpeg actually writes is an AAF-compatible TaggedValue referenced from the package's local tag 0x4406,
# not an ST 377-1 Comment Marker and not a DM Framework (those are timeline descriptive-metadata objects,
# ST 377-1 Annex B.30-B.32). And ffmpeg's demuxer reads that same private construction back as comment_<key>,
# so ffprobe round-tripping them is NOT independent confirmation of anything.
#
# NEITHER Avid nor Blackmagic documents Media Composer or Resolve surfacing arbitrary TaggedValue. Avid's
# published guides speak of embedded Tape Name, timecode and film metadata; Resolve's manual speaks of Reel
# Name. So the honest position is: reel_name is a real interchange field, the other ten are best-effort and
# THE SIDECAR .json IS THEIR RELIABLE CARRIER. The documented route into Avid for the rest is an ALE, and into
# Resolve its own metadata import - neither is written here yet.
#
# Out of scope and NOT claimed: ST 377-1 descriptive metadata schemes and IMF ST 2067 packages.

    """Colorspace name -> filename token, spelled out in full so that no two colorspaces can share one.

    'ACEScg' -> 'acescg', 'sRGB - Display' -> 'srgb_display',
    'Rec.1886 Rec.709 - Display' -> 'rec_1886_rec_709_display',
    'Linear ARRI Wide Gamut 4' -> 'linear_arri_wide_gamut_4'.

    WHY THIS REPLACED A TABLE OF SHORT TAGS (2026-08-12). The old scheme kept a "core token" and dropped the
    descriptive tail, which made 31 of the config's 55 colorspaces share a tag with at least one other:
    thirteen different GAMUTS all became 'linear' (ARRI AWG3 and AWG4, BMD, DaVinci, CinemaGamut, D-Gamut,
    V-Gamut, REDWideGamut, four S-Gamut3 variants, AdobeRGB); eight different TRANSFERS all became 'rec709'
    (Gamma 1.8 / 2.2 / 2.4, Rec.1886, sRGB-encoded, Camera Rec.709); six became 'p3', putting HDR PQ
    ST2084-P3-D65 next to SDR Display P3; and ARRI LogC3 and LogC4 both became 'logc'.

    That was not cosmetic. `_write_output_paths` builds the DELIVERED PATH from this token, so two writes
    differing only in output_colorspace produced the SAME filename and the second silently overwrote the
    first. The artist believes two versions exist, one does, and which one is not recoverable from the name.
    Spelling the name out takes the number of colliding colorspaces to zero.

    The length objection does not survive measurement: the old sanitiser truncated at 24 characters, and the
    longest spelled-out tag is 30 ('davinci_intermediate_widegamut'). Six characters, against 31 ambiguous
    deliverables.

    Names that were already unambiguous come out UNCHANGED - 'acescg', 'acescct', 'aces2065_1',
    'rec_2100_hlg_display', 'rec_2100_pq_display' - because for those the old fall-through already produced
    the spelled-out form.

    NOT TRUNCATED, deliberately. A fixed-width cut would re-introduce collisions between any two names sharing
    a prefix, which is the whole defect this removes. tools/test_cs_tag_unique.py asserts that no two
    colorspaces in the live config collide, so a truncation cannot be reintroduced quietly.

    THERE ARE TWO DIFFERENT VERSIONS IN PLAY and conflating them is what made the old layout wrong. The WORKFLOW
    has a version, which is part of its name and changes when the artist decides it does (`..._workflow_v02`).
    A RENDER has a version, which is "how many times I have pressed render", and that one belongs to the output.
    So the name gives the FOLDER and the render count gives what is inside it:

    Everything one render produced therefore shares a folder AND a version, and the output dir holds one entry
    per workflow instead of a flat pile that grows by several files every time anyone hits render.

    auto_version off = the artist is doing their own numbering, so the folder is used exactly as typed. Taking
