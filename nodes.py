# ComfyUI-OCIO - OpenColorIO nodes for ComfyUI, modelled on The Foundry Nuke's OCIO node set.
# @author Slava Sexton, 2026-06-30
#
# Six nodes: OCIO ColorSpace, OCIO LogConvert, OCIO Display, OCIO CDLTransform,
# OCIO FileTransform, OCIO LookTransform. All IMAGE -> IMAGE, float, and none of them adds a clip of its own.
#
# "NO CLIP" IS A STATEMENT ABOUT THIS CODE, NOT A PROMISE ABOUT THE RESULT, and the difference is not academic
# (qualified 2026-08-13 after a reviewer measured it). A 3D LUT has a bounded input domain, so OCIO clamps to that
# domain before interpolating - which is correct, and is what Nuke does too. Feed a scene-linear plate peaking at
# 15.37 through a .cube defined over 0..1 and the highlights are gone: measured 1.05 out, exactly the LUT's own
# corner value, with no error and a write that reports success. The same LUT applied AFTER a log encode behaves as
# expected. So for OCIO FileTransform and OCIO LookTransform the data has to already be in the domain the file was
# authored for. That is the user's call; this code cannot correct it without silently changing the transform.
#
# Pickers, not free text: colorspaces, displays, views, looks are dropdowns from the active config;
# config (.ocio) and LUT files are dropdowns of files in the ComfyUI input folder (drop a file there to
# see it). A one-press "swap" button (web/ocio_swap.js) flips in/out (ColorSpace, Look) or the operation
# (LogConvert).
#
# Implementation notes (confirmed vs inferred):
#  - LogConvert curves are published specs, verified by round-trip + black-point tests (tools/):
#    Cineon (OCIO nuke-default, black 0->0.0928, matches Nuke), ACEScct (S-2016-001), ACEScc (S-2014-003).
#  - The OpenColorIO-backed paths use the OCIO 2.x Python API (PackedImageDesc + apply), verified at runtime
#    against the built-in ACES studio config (OCIO 2.5.2). Requires the `opencolorio` package.

# WHERE THIS IS WIRED, AND WHY ONLY THERE. Measured per node with distinct values from 1.5 to 500 above
# white and -0.02 to -1.0 below black, reading back whether distinct values stayed distinct:
#
#   OCIO ColorSpace     no collapse in any case tested - a no-op, a matrix (ACEScg to ACES2065-1), a
#                       display encoding (to sRGB - Display) and a log encoding (to ACEScct). 500 goes in
#                       and comes out separated. NOT wired: a warning that cannot fire is dead code.
#   OCIO CDLTransform   no collapse; a slope/offset/power grade is per-channel arithmetic. 500 -> 525.
#                       NOT wired, same reason.
#   OCIO Display        negatives all become exactly 0.000000, and that is what a display transform IS.
#                       Above white it compresses but keeps separation. NOT wired: it would fire on every
#                       correct use, which is how a warning teaches people to ignore it.
#   OCIO LogConvert     our own Python curves. Eight of ten keep negatives separated; ACEScc and Cineon
#                       floor them by published definition, so those two are suppressed by name below.
#                       WIRED, because a future curve could clip the high side and nothing else would say.
#   OCIO FileTransform  both sides collapse: above white onto the LUT's own corner value, below black
#                       onto 0. The domain belongs to the FILE, and getting it wrong is the mistake this
#                       whole function exists for. WIRED.
#   OCIO LookTransform  same engine and the same file-domain exposure. WIRED.
#
# So the pack's own maths does not clamp. What clamps is a LUT's domain, a display transform by design, and
# two curve definitions. The warning belongs where a user can be surprised, not everywhere.
def _report_range_loss(before, after, label, expect_low_clip=False):
    """Say so when a transform threw away range the input had. Logged, never raised.

    THE CASE THIS EXISTS FOR is a LUT applied to scene-linear data. A 3D LUT is defined over a bounded input
    domain, so OCIO clamps to that domain before interpolating, which is correct and is what Nuke does too. The
    consequence is not obvious: a plate peaking at 15.37 through a .cube defined over 0..1 comes out at 1.05,
    the LUT's own corner value, and the write that follows reports success over destroyed highlights. Nothing in
    the graph said anything.

    Deliberately a log line and not an output. Every colour node returns `(IMAGE, VIDEO)` through _dual_io, and
    turning that into ComfyUI's `{"ui":..., "result":...}` form would change what `node.convert(...)[0]` means for
    every caller: this pack's own tests, the snippets in its docs, and anyone's script. Surfacing it ON the node
    is worth doing and is a deliberate change to six shipped signatures, not a line to slip in here.

# Gamut -> ACEScg for the gamut. Constants confirmed from Canon's own primary spec: "Canon Log Gamma Curves"
# white paper (Canon USA, November 1 2018), Appendix [3] "Canon Log 3 (Full %)". Three-piece curve: negative
# log branch (x < -0.014), a linear mid segment (-0.014 <= x <= 0.014) that keeps the curve C1-continuous
# across both breakpoints, and a positive log branch (x > 0.014). Anchor: this code's x is direct scene-linear
# reflectance (0.18 = 18% grey, matching every other curve in this file); Canon's own table indexes by "Scene
# Linear %" with reflection = Scene Linear * 0.9, so Canon's own tabulated "18% Grey" row (input 0.20 in their
# convention) reads CV 351 / 0.343 - confirmed from the same doc's Appendix [4] table. At x=0.18 direct
# (this code's convention) the value is ~0.3298.
#
# THAT WAS "inferred consistent with the formula" AND IS NOW MEASURED (2026-08-13), against an implementation
# nobody here wrote: the config's own CanonLog3 CinemaGamut D55, with primaries matched on both sides so only the
# transfer differs. The whole curve agrees under exactly the 0.9 input convention described above -
#
#   encode:  ours(x)                  == theirs(x * 0.9)   to 1.19e-07   over linear 0.01 .. 4.0
#   decode:  ours(code) * 0.9         == theirs(code)      to 6.68e-06   over codes 0.2 .. 1.0,
#            and the ratio ours/theirs is 1/0.9 to seven digits (1.11111021 .. 1.11111140), i.e. a constant
#
# both residuals being float32 quantisation at those magnitudes rather than a difference in the maths. So the two
# routes are the same curve on two input conventions, and mixing them costs log2(1/0.9) = 0.152 stops. That is why
# the tooltip says to pair this node with a camera-gamut ColorSpace step and NOT with the config's same-named
# colorspace: the difference is silent, small enough to survive a look, and large enough to fail a match.

        Never raises. A config that will not resolve is not this method's problem to report; run() says so
